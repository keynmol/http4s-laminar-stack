# http4s-laminar-stack ![build](https://github.com/keynmol/http4s-laminar-stack/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Example of 

1. Client written with [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar), interacting with server using [sttp](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp)

2. Server with http4s serving both the compiled Javascript for the client and an endpoint for server-side interactions

3. Shared code with **protocol** definitions

4. Gzip compression on the server side

5. Docker packaging of the full application

6. Tests for the client with simulated DOM using [jsdom](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-env-jsdom-nodejs)

## Development mode

Run in SBT (uses fast JS compilation, not optimized):

```
sbt> ~runDev
```

And open http://localhost:9000/frontend

This will restart the server on any changes: shared code, client/server, assets.

## Tests
It is a prerequisite to have jsdom installed, in order for the frontend tests to run. Proposal:
```
yarn add jsdom
```
Then move into an sbt console and run tests as normal

## Production mode

Run in SBT (uses full JS optimization):

```
sbt> ~runProd
```

## Docker packaging 

```
sbt> backend/docker:publishLocal
```

Will publish the docker image with fully optimised JS code, and you can run the container:

```bash
✗ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 backend:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT

The interface is fairly simple:
